This README explains how you can implement a secure user authentication feature that ensures passwords are never sent or stored in plain text. Below are the core steps:

1. Use HTTPS
By configuring an HTTPS server (e.g., with a self-signed certificate in development or a trusted certificate in production), all communication between the client and server is encrypted. This prevents passwords from being read in transit.

2. Hash Passwords with Bcrypt (or Argon2)
In our server.js, we use a library like bcrypt to securely hash (and salt) the user's password before saving it. For example:


// Example registration route
app.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  
  // Generate a salted hash
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  
  // Store the hashed password in our "database"
  users.push({ username, passwordHash });
  res.send('User registered successfully!');
});
    
The important point is that you never store or log the raw password; you only keep the hashed version. If an attacker somehow accesses the database, they won’t directly get the user’s actual password.

3. Verify Passwords on Login
When a user logs in, you compare their typed-in password (hashed again behind the scenes) with the stored hash:


// Example login route
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);
  if (!user) return res.send('Invalid username or password');

  // Compare typed-in password with stored hash
  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash);
  if (!isMatch) return res.send('Invalid username or password');

  // If successful, create a session or token
  req.session.user = { username };
  res.send(`Welcome, ${username}!`);
});
    
4. Session Management
We used express-session to create and manage user sessions, storing a session ID in a cookie. This means the user doesn’t have to re-enter their password for each request. The session data is stored server-side, never exposing the raw password.

5. Summary of Best Practices
Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Use a proper hashing function (bcrypt, argon2) with salting.
Store only hashed passwords in your database—never plaintext.
Implement sessions or tokens so users don’t need to keep sending credentials.
Keep secrets (session secrets, DB passwords) in environment variables.
Consider rate limiting on login endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
By following these steps, another developer can easily replicate this setup. They would just need:
- A Node.js server (using Express)
- The bcrypt (or argon2) library
- A session management library (e.g. express-session)
- A client-side form for Register and Login.
